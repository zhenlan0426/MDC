help me understand what each function does and how they come together?

I'll help you understand the structure and functionality of this test script. Let me analyze the code to provide you with a comprehensive breakdown.

Now let me create a visual diagram to help you understand how all the functions work together:

Now let me explain each function and how they work together:

## Core Architecture Overview

The `test_extraction_improved.py` script is a **comprehensive testing framework** that evaluates how well the data extraction utilities can find scientific data identifiers (like DOIs, database IDs, etc.) in research papers. Here's how it works:

## Main Components & Functions

### 1. **ImprovedExtractionTester Class** (Lines 30-463)
This is the main orchestrator that coordinates all testing operations:

**Key attributes:**
- `ground_truth`: Dictionary storing known correct data references from CSV labels
- `extracted_results`: List of identifiers found by the extraction algorithms
- `patterns`: Regex patterns for finding different types of identifiers

### 2. **Ground Truth Management**

**`load_ground_truth()`** (Lines 44-64)
- Reads a CSV file containing manually labeled data references
- Builds a dictionary: `{article_id: {dataset_id: type}}`
- Skips entries marked as "Missing"

**`analyze_ground_truth_patterns()`** (Lines 66-101)
- Analyzes what types of identifiers exist in the ground truth
- Counts pattern frequencies (DOI, PDB, GenBank, etc.)
- Provides examples of each identifier type
- This helps understand what the extraction should find

### 3. **Data Extraction Pipeline**

**`extract_from_pdfs()`** (Lines 135-174)
- Calls the main extraction function from `data_extraction_utils.py`
- Can process a subset of files for testing
- Applies improved filtering to reduce false positives
- Uses PyMuPDF to extract text from PDF files

**Key helper functions from `data_extraction_utils.py`:**
- `extract_data_references_from_pdfs()`: Main extraction orchestrator
- `extract_text_from_pdf()`: Uses PyMuPDF to get text from PDFs
- `extract_identifiers_from_text()`: Applies regex patterns to find identifiers
- `get_comprehensive_patterns()`: Returns 18+ regex patterns for different identifier types

### 4. **False Positive Filtering**

**`improved_false_positive_filter()`** (Lines 103-133)
- Removes common false positives like:
  - Years (1900-2099)
  - Figure/table references
  - Statistical values (p-values, sample sizes)
  - Chemical formulas
- Uses context analysis to avoid non-data references

**`validate_identifier_content()`** (Lines 135-158)
- Additional validation for identifier quality
- Rejects very short identifiers
- Ensures PDB codes have letters, not just numbers
- Filters out generic chemical formulas

### 5. **Performance Evaluation**

**`calculate_detailed_metrics()`** (Lines 185-230)
- Compares extracted identifiers against ground truth
- Calculates standard ML metrics:
  - **True Positives**: Correctly identified data references
  - **False Positives**: Incorrectly identified as data references
  - **False Negatives**: Missed data references
  - **Precision**: TP / (TP + FP) - accuracy of positive predictions
  - **Recall**: TP / (TP + FN) - coverage of actual positives
  - **F1 Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall

### 6. **Reporting & Analysis**

**`generate_comprehensive_report()`** (Lines 232-307)
- Creates detailed performance report including:
  - Ground truth statistics
  - Overall performance metrics
  - Top missed identifiers (for improvement)
  - Top false positives (for filtering refinement)
  - Successful matches examples

**`save_results()`** (Lines 309-351)
- Saves results in JSON format for programmatic analysis
- Saves human-readable text report

## How They Work Together

```
1. INITIALIZATION
   ├── Load ground truth labels from CSV
   ├── Analyze what identifier types exist
   └── Set up regex patterns for extraction

2. EXTRACTION PHASE  
   ├── Process PDF files with PyMuPDF
   ├── Apply 18+ regex patterns to find identifiers
   ├── Filter false positives using context analysis
   └── Normalize identifiers for comparison

3. EVALUATION PHASE
   ├── Compare extracted vs ground truth identifiers
   ├── Calculate precision, recall, F1 scores
   ├── Identify specific successes and failures
   └── Generate detailed performance reports

4. OUTPUT PHASE
   ├── Save JSON results for further analysis
   ├── Create human-readable reports
   └── Provide actionable insights for improvement
```

## Key Design Patterns

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Extraction logic is in `data_extraction_utils.py`, testing logic is separate
2. **Progressive Filtering**: Raw extraction → false positive filtering → validation → normalization
3. **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Not just overall accuracy, but detailed analysis of failure modes
4. **Actionable Insights**: Reports show specific missed identifiers and false positives for targeted improvements

This architecture allows for systematic testing and improvement of the data extraction algorithms, with clear visibility into what's working well and what needs refinement.
